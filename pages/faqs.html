              <h4>What is auxi.my?</h4>
              <p>
                auxi.my is a mobile app that serves as a collaborative
                crowdsourcing platform, allowing users to crowdsource their
                assignments and homework. It connects students who need
                assistance with knowledgeable helpers who can assist and guide
                them towards their goals.

              <h4>How does auxi.my work?</h4>
              <p>
                auxi.my works by leveraging the collective knowledge and
                expertise of its user community. Users who require assignment
                help first post their assignment requests, and users with
                relevant expertise will bid to obtain the assignment. The
                requesting users can chat with the bidders using our in-app chat
                or externally (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, etc) through the
                bidders' provided contact number. Ultimately, the decision lies
                solely on the requester to choose who can perform the task.
